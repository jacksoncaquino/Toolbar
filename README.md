I have created buttons to host some of the tools that are described in other projects in this portfolio.

When doing our market studies, it's not uncommon to find countries where the currencies make it in a way that pay range midpoints had too many zeroes. I've created buttons to make it easier to select a few jobs and increase them by a certain percentage, as well as checking if the person pricing the job is following all the rules we had previously agreed upon.

Creating an EIB (enterprise interface builder) for Workday can be a tedious process. I created macros to get things from our own files and translate into the format Workday consumes, making the whole mass upload process much easier and error-free.

## Brief descriptions of what each tool does

I added descriptions to help the team better understand what tools to use and when. They just needed to hover over the buttons to see the descriptions.
